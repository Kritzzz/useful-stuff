Kim Kardashian is a short overweight woman, who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves... In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit.
# Installation (Mac)

So, this is how I do it:

1. Put the repo somewhere
2. Get virtualenv (```easy_install virtualenv```) if you do not have it yet (as long as you want to test this locally. Otherwise, go to step 4)
3. Create a new virtualenv inside the downloaded folder with ```virtualenv venv```, open it with ```. venv/bin/activate```
4. Install all the stuff with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Start the testserver with ```python runme.py```
8. Respect My Authority!
